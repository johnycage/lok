## FAQ
faq-title = Frequently Asked Questions

faq-what-cv-q = What is Project Lok-Vacha?
faq-what-cv-a = Lok means people; Vacha means voice. Project Lok-Vacha is about collecting speech samples of real people and not just voice-over professionals. Voice recognition technology is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines, but the currently available systems are expensive and proprietary. Lok-Vacha is a database of donated voices of Indian speakers that lets anyone quickly and easily train voice-enabled apps in potentially all language. We're specifically collecting voice samples of Indian languages starting with more popular 15 languages (including Indian English & Hinglish) followed by more distant and less spoken languages and other dialects. The project ensures to cover the real-life colloquial language, words and phrases, including Hinglish. This makes the application more practical and relevant.  

faq-why-important-q = Why is it important?
faq-why-important-a = Speech is often the most natural way we communicate with each other and voice technologies are bringing that convenience to our computers and mobile devices. We want to empower developers to build amazing voice recognition applications like real-time transcription, translation and voice-enabled digital assistants. But right now most of the voice data required to build these kinds of apps is expensive. We hope the Lok-Vacha dataset will give developers what they need to innovate and make speech technology available in their own language. To make voice recognition even more universal, we're collecting voice samples from all corners of India. 

faq-what-todo-q = What are you going to do with these voice samples?
faq-what-todo-a = Having such diverse dataset of voices will empower developers, entrepreneurs, and communities to address this gap themselves. In addition to the project Lok-Vacha, we’re also building Speech Recognition Engine for Hinglish and all Indian languages called Vacha.AI. 

faq-hinglish-q = What is Hinglish?
faq-hinglish-a = Hinglish is a portmanteau (a blend word) of "Hindi" and "English". Hinglish may also contain words / references from other Indian languages and is not just restricted to Hindi. It is also used sometimes to refer to very peculiar usage /invention of words by Indians, even in a formal context. 

faq-what-cv-and-deepspeech-q = What’s the difference between Lok-Vacha and Vacha.AI?
faq-what-cv-and-deepspeech-a = Project Lok-Vacha is about collecting the audio samples of Indian languages. Vacha.AI is a Speech recognition engine, that uses the labelled data collected by Lok-Vacha.

faq-is-goal-assistant-q = Is the goal of this app to build a voice assistant like Siri, Alexa, Cortana?
faq-is-goal-assistant-a = The goal of the Project Lok-Vacha is to build a voice-text dataset. We are aiming to collect 10,000 hours of audio data for all major Indian (Indian subcontinent) languages.   is to enable anyone in the world to build speech recognition, speaker recognition, or any other type of application that requires voice data. A voice assistant is just one of many types of applications you could use the dataset to build.

faq-list-q = Which languages I can contribute to? 
faq-list-a = Currently, we are allowing people to speak & validate 15 languages, these are: Indian English, Hindi, Bangali, Urdu, Assamese, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Mallayallam, Nepali, Odiya.

faq-do-want-native-q = I am a non-native speaker and I speak with an accent, do you still want my voice?
faq-do-want-native-a = Yes, we especially want your voice! Part of the aim of Lok-Vacha is to gather as many different accents as possible so that voice recognition services work equally well for everyone. This means donations from non-native speakers are particularly important.

faq-why-different-speakers-q = Why do you need so many different speakers per language?
faq-why-different-speakers-a = Most speech databases are trained with over-over professional artists with an overrepresentation of certain demographics, which results in a bias towards male and middle class. Accents and dialects that tend to be under-represented in training data sets are typically associated with groups of people who are already marginalised. Many machines also struggle to understand female voices. The variety and randomness is good for ML problem.

faq-why-my-lang-q = Why is my language is not included yet?
faq-why-my-lang-new-a = We are specifically working on languages spoken in India. If you speak one of 6000+ Indian languages, which is not listed here, you can mail us. We may add Marwadi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, Maithili, Dogri, Konkani, Bodo in next phase of development of this app. 

faq-what-quality-q = What level of audio quality is required for a voice clip to be used in the dataset?
faq-what-quality-a = We want the Lok-Vacha dataset to reflect the audio quality a speech-to-text engine will hear in the wild, so we’re looking for variety. In addition to a diverse community of speakers, a dataset with varying audio quality will teach the speech-to-text engine to handle various real-world situations, from background talking to car noise. As long as your voice clip is intelligible, it should be good enough for the dataset.

faq-why-10k-hours-q = Why is 10,000 validated hours the per language goal for capturing audio?
faq-why-10k-hours-a = Research in Deep Learning/ AI technology says that 10,000 hours of audio data is approximately the number of hours required to train a production-ready speech-to-text system.
 
faq-how-calc-hours-q = How does you calculate hours?
faq-how-calc-hours-a = We calculate hours by estimating the average length of each recording, and then multiplying that number by the total number of recordings across all languages.

faq-how-get-q = How can I get the Lok-Vacha data?
faq-how-get-a = The data is not ready yet. Even after collecting good amount of data, bundling, cleaning, and labelling the data will require additional time and resources.  We may release the data for AI/ML developers and enthusiasts once it’s large enough. 

faq-pay-now-q = I’m ready to pay for the vernacular data, can I get it now? 
faq-pay-now-a = We appeal you to help us spread the word about this project; and convince people to donate their voices. This will fasten the data collection process and the release timeline. 

faq-contribute-q = How can I contribute?
faq-contribute-a = You can contribute by creating an account; donating your voice by speaking out loud the sentences provided by the app; and validating the other voices by approving/rejecting others work. Signing up for the account at Lok-Vacha would help the project increase the accuracy of the ASR model. 

faq-why-account-q = Why should I sign up for an account?
faq-is-account-public-q = Is my account information public?
faq-is-account-public-a = No.
